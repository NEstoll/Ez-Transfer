Usage Instructions: On the first screen of the app, you should see a list of available devices, selecting one will bring you to the file selection to choose which files you would like to send to that device. You will end on a loading screen to confirm your file is sent. Then you just use the android back button to return to the device screen.

Known Bugs: No currently known bugs other than functionality not yet being implemented.

Areas for Feedback: Should we include the separate screen for file selection, or would this be better done with purely using an intent to interact with that device's file system and have that handle the file selection process itself?
