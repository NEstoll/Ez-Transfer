Usage Instructions: When first opening the app, you will see a screen that says "Please enable bluetooth", to get to the file selection portion, you must go to the settings for our app and allow bluetooth there.
The file selector should now be the first thing to appear, select a file that you would transfer to another device then press the next button.
This now takes you to the device selection screen, a list of nearby devices would appear here. Select a device to start the transfer (or press next for now).
The transfer screen now appears with a progress bar.

Known Bugs: 
- The permissions are not prompted to be changed
- There is no list of devices

Areas for Feedback: What other functionality would be helpful within the app and should the file selection or device selection come first?

Alpha Release Feedback: Largely our alpha release feedback was centered around making the UI less simplistic.
	To address this, we made a top bar including the app name, we also centered more of our screen content to make it more central, and made the device button the full screen width.
